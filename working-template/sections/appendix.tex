\section{Statistical Analysis Details}\label{app:stats}

\subsection{Cohen's Kappa Calculation}
Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Cohen's Kappa:

\[
\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}
\]

where $p_o$ is the observed agreement and $p_e$ is the expected agreement by chance.

\subsection{Chi-Square Test for Independence}
For categorical paradigms (RVS, Anthropic Value Tree), we used chi-square tests:

\[
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
\]

where $O_{ij}$ are observed frequencies and $E_{ij}$ are expected frequencies under independence.
