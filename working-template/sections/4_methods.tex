% Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation: 
% \begin{quote}
% \tt\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
% \end{quote}
% This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.
