\section{DeepReflect}
% ~1440 words ≈ ~11–12 paragraphs
% DeepReflect is designed to cater to two broad categories of users:
% 1. Users who frequently interact with LLMs for personal queries. 
% 2. Researchers interested in the large scale analysis and shift in psychosocial paradigms.

\subsection{System Design}\label{sec:deepreflect}
% Design is precise, methodical and shows some flair.
\textcolor{black!40}{Your model: Flesh out your own approach, perhaps amplifying themes from the 'Prior lit' section.}

\subsubsection{Test Cases}
\textcolor{black!40}{Default synethetic test cases developed for sanity checks.}
\textcolor{black!40}{Ensure that it is evident to the reader that these are test cases for DeepReflect as a software system and that experiments conducted with the system design on the dataset are outlines in the methodology section.}

\subsubsection{Analyses}
% Default synthetic test cases developed for sanity checks.

\subsubsection{Generations}
% Default synthetic test cases developed for sanity checks.
\textcolor{black!40}{Generations produced on the basis of analyses with one of two methods: 1. Chain-of-thought reasoning 2. Production of a synthetic dataset for fine-tuning.}

\textcolor{black!30}{The RedArcs - and reference the ethics section. Limitations of the dataset - how it is not representative of the entire population, but a subset of the population that is more likely to use LLMs for personal queries - WEIRD.}
