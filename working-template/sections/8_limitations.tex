\section*{Limitations}
\textcolor{black!40}{API calls incur costs - funding and time limitations - can broaden DeepReflect to include other models (LLMs) and other psychosocial frameworks - especially frameworks on ethics which have been historically used in personal decision-making on which rich literature exists from historic accounts of deep human philosphical thought such as Kantian ethics, Utilitarianism, and Virtue Ethics, Stoicism, Gita - Vedic Philosoph, Buddhism. The Reddit dataset is rich and can be dissected in ways to aid a more nuanced understanding of the social values and influences that shape our personal lives and interactions.}
\textcolor{black!30}{ACL 2023 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.
The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.}
\textcolor{black!30}{While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.}
\textcolor{black!30}{In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.}
